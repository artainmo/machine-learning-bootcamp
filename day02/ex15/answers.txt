1. Overfitting consists of having a ML model that is too precise towards training data making it less effective on non-training data due to not generalizing.
2. Underfitting consists of having a ML model not precise enough on training data and thus non-training data too.
3. Splitting data in training and test set is important to detect overfitting.
4. Training set will have way lower cost than test set.
5. On both sets cost function score will be high.

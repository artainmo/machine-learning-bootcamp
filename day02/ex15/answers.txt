1. Overfitting consists of having a ML model that is too precise towards training data making it less effective on non-training data
2. Underfitting consists of having a ML model not precise enough for training  and thus non-training data
3. Splitting data in training and test set is important to detect overfitting
4. Training set will have way better cost function score than test set
5. On both sets cost function score will be high
